python was developed by "Guido Van Rossum".
It was developed in 1991.

Variables:
Variables are fundamental to programming for two reasons:
    ● Variables keep values accessible
    ● Variables give values context

Data types:
    ● Numbers
        ○ Integers
        ○ Floating Point Numbers 
        ○ Complex Numbers
    ● Strings 
    ● Boolean Values 
    ● List, Tuple, and Dictionary

Scope:
There are broadly two kinds of scopes in Python − 
    ● Global scope
    ● Local scope
The time for which the variable exists in memory is called the lifetime of that variable:
    ● The lifetime of a Global variable is the entire program run (i.e., they live in the memory as long as the program is being executed).
    ● The lifetime of a Local variable is their function’s run (i.e., as long as their function is being executed).
